This repo will house my course assignments for CS4550 Web Development.

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science and Design major at Northeastern University, and am currently also working part-time as a full-stack developer at PowerAdvocate. I have past experience as a front-end developer working with a client through Scout, a student run organization through Northeastern's College of Arts, Media Design.
